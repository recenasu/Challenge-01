# Challenge-01 - HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description
The purpose of this project is to perform code refactoring on the Horiseon webpage to address the following user story and acceptance criteria. Acceptance Criteria have been broken down into indidivual features (e.g. AC01). For details on each implementation, review the applicable 'AC' number in the "Features" section of this README.

### User Story

* AS A marketing agency,
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards,
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria

> * AC01: Accessibility Standards
>    - GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
>    - (Apply items in “Things to always do…” in the Challenge README)

>* AC02: Semantic HTML Elements
>    -	WHEN I view the source code
>    -	THEN I find semantic HTML elements

>* AC03: Logical Structure
>    -	WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
>    -	THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

>* AC04: Accessible alt Attributes
>    -	WHEN I view the icon and image elements
>    -	THEN I find accessible alt attributes

>* AC05: Sequential Heading Attributes
>    -	WHEN I view the heading attributes
